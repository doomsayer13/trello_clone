App Academy Final Project - Trello Clone

This is an application inspired by Trello. It is built using Rails, Backbone, and Bootsrap.

A collaborative project management web application. Upon account creation a user can create projects (boards), lists (project steps), and tasks (cards). Users can add team members to their projects, assign tasks, and comment on their progress. As tasks progress users are able to interactively drag their tasks to the next step of the project. You can demo the application [here.](http://www.martrello.com)
